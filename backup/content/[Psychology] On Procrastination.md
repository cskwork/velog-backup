6 Ways to Combat Procrastination for Adults With ADHD
### Procrastination
- Psychological purpose of short-term mood repair
- Brain's emotional response to a distressing issue protecting us against fear of failure, judgment by others and self-condemnation
- People who procrastinate have higher levels of stress and lower well-being
- Unconsious way the mind tries to take away one's anxiety.
- A paradox because the avoidance of pressure actualy amplifies the pressure

### Potential Procrastiation Cures
- Break things down
- Commit to short time chunks
- Amp up self-compassion
	- There is a direct link between self-compassion and success.
    - Being kinder to yoursef instead helps you bounce back quicker.
    - Studies show that forgiving yourself for previous delays neutralizes procrastination -> boosts motivation.
- Curb your perfectionism (Start with imperfect first draft)
- Chill your faultfinder
	- When you hear a voice within say, "You must, you should or be something".
    Talk to it with compassion and remind it that you will be the one to choose.
- Avoid labeling yourself a procrastinator
	- Think of your procrastinator as a part of you, not as you. 
- Reward yourself
- Set priorities
- Set lifelines instead of deadlines
	- Have time to breathe, eat a snack, rest in between tasks. 
- Consider long-term benefits
	- When you procrastinate you focus on the immediate relief instead of gains completing the future product.
    - Concentrate on the gains of the final outcome and less on the short term relief.
