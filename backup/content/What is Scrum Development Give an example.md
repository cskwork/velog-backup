### What is scrum?
**Scrum is an Agile software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development.** 
Scrum focuses on delivering incremental value to stakeholders through a series of sprints, which are short time-boxed iterations in which a small, cross-functional team works to deliver a complete, usable product increment.

In Scrum, a product backlog is maintained, which is a **prioritized list of features and requirements that the team intends to implement in future sprints**. 
During each sprint, the team selects items from the product backlog to work on and focuses on delivering a working increment of the product.
At the end of each sprint, the team holds a sprint review to demonstrate what they have delivered and receive feedback from stakeholders.

Scrum places a strong emphasis on transparency, inspection, and adaptation, with regular retrospectives held to reflect on what worked well and what can be improved in future sprints. 
The Scrum team, which includes the product owner, the development team, and the scrum master, is empowered to make decisions and continuously improve their process and the product.

Scrum is widely used in software development and has proven to be an effective method for delivering high-quality software products in a fast-paced and constantly changing environment.

### Give an example!

An example of Scrum development is the creation of a new mobile app for a restaurant.
The process might look something like this:

1** Product backlog**: The product owner creates a product backlog with a list of features for the app, such as menu displays, ordering, payment, and loyalty program integration. The items in the product backlog are prioritized based on importance and dependencies.

2** Sprint planning**: The development team selects items from the product backlog for the first sprint and creates a sprint backlog with specific tasks to be completed. The team decides how much work they can realistically accomplish in the sprint and commits to delivering that work.

3 **Sprint execution**: During the sprint, the development team works on completing the tasks in the sprint backlog. They hold daily **Scrum meetings** to discuss progress, resolve obstacles, and coordinate work.

4 **Sprint review**: At the end of the sprint, the development team demonstrates the working software they have delivered and receives feedback from **stakeholders**. They also review their process and make changes to improve their efficiency and effectiveness.

5 **Sprint retrospective**: The team reflects on the sprint and identifies what worked well and what could be improved in future sprints. They make a plan to incorporate these improvements into the next sprint.

6 Repeat: The team repeats this process, delivering working software in each sprint, until the app is complete and meets the needs of the stakeholders.

This is just one example of Scrum development, and the specific steps and activities may vary depending on the needs of the project and the team. 
Scrum provides a flexible framework for delivering software and allows for continuous improvement and adaptation to changing requirements.
