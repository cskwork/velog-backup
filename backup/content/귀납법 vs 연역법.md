## Inductive Reasoning (귀납 추론) : 
- Bottom-up approach (cause-and-effect)
- Finding patterns from observations.

## Deductive Reasoning (연역적 추론) :
- if A(명제)=B and B=C, the A=C
- Top-down approach to drawing conclusion.
- 알려진 이론(명제)을 어떤 현상에 대입(추론 규칙을 찾아)해서 결론을 도출.

### Tips to improve
- Be curious ( Deduce from info. you already have )
- Be observational
- Increase your knowledge
- Break problems into smaller pieces
- Try to anticipate outcome of decisions. 
- Practice Math
