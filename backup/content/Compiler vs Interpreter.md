Binary
- machine code
- set of instructions given to machine and run by its CPU
- low level
- Translated result from source code

Compiler
- Takes high level language and converts it into machine code
- Goes through the whole source code and translates them in one go.

Interpreter
- Takes high level language and converts it into machine code and then
executes the code immediately.
- Translates piece by piece and executes piece by piece.
